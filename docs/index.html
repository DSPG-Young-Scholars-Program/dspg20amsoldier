        <h3>Project Overview</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">Our work is part of the broader <a href="https://www.zooniverse.org/projects/tkotwim/the-american-soldier/about/research">American Soldier in World War II</a> initiative, based out of Virginia Tech, striving to make available to scholars and to the public a <a href="https://catalog.archives.gov/id/2521127">remarkable collection of written reflections</a> on war and military service by American soldiers who served during the Second World War. In its efforts to mobilize, train, equip, and lead the largest fighting force in the nation’s history, the US War Department created an in-house Army Research Branch (ARB) staffed and advised by the country’s leading social and behavioral scientists. To help create a more efficient and effective fighting force, the Branch surveyed approximately half a million individuals over the course of the war. Tens of thousands of these men and women not only filled out the Branch’s surveys, but they were eager to offer additional advice, praise, and criticism, and to share their personal stories of serving in America’s “citizen-soldier” Army.</p>

        <h3>Project Goals</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">This project is devoted to giving the public insight into WWII survey data collected in 1943. More specifically, we are interested in exploring what the open-ended text data that was collected in these surveys can tell us about race, gender and family relations among and between Black and White soldiers. WWII changed gender and race relations in the US in transformative ways by allowing women to work outside the home (not only in war industries but also in the military) and by helping to sound the death knell for racial segregation. The DSPG project aims to analyze textual data produced as part of The American Soldier in World War II, a federally funded, multi-institutional digital history project which is designed to raise public awareness on the experiences of World War II American GIs. The project harvests data from a unique and historic collection of “attitude surveys” that were administered to hundreds of thousands of American Army troops during the war. The DSPG team analyzed soldiers’ handwritten responses by using computational text analysis and social network analysis to dive into soldiers’ attitudes about racial and ethnic relations as well as gender relations.</p>

It continued until June 22. It was suppressed after 6,000 federal troops were ordered into the city to restore peace. A total of 34 people were killed, 25 of them black and most at the hands of the white police force; 433 were wounded, 75 percent of them black; and property valued at $2 million ($27.5 million in 2015 US dollars) was destroyed. Most of the riot took place in the black area of Paradise Valley, the poorest neighborhood of the city. It occurred in a period of dramatic population increase and social tensions associated with the military buildup of World War II, as Detroit's automotive industry was converted to the war effort.","The Agana Race Riot (December 24–26, 1944) took place in Agana, Guam, as the result of internal disputes between white and black United States Marines. The riot was one of the most serious incidents between African-American and European-American military personnel in the United States Armed Forces during World War II.","Issued on July 26, 1948, by President Harry S. Truman. It abolished discrimination \"on the basis of race, color, religion or national origin\" in the United States Armed Forces, which led to the end of segregation in the services during the Korean War (1950-1953).","Jack Roosevelt Robinson (January 31, 1919 – October 24, 1972) was an American professional baseball player who became the first African American to play in Major League Baseball (MLB) in the modern era. Robinson broke the baseball color line when he started at first base for the Brooklyn Dodgers on April 15, 1947. When the Dodgers signed Robinson, they heralded the end of racial segregation in professional baseball that had relegated black players to the Negro leagues since the 1880s. Robinson was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1962.","The attack on Pearl Harbor was a surprise, preemptive military strike by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service upon the United States (a neutral country at the time) against the naval base at Pearl Harbor in Honolulu, Territory of Hawaii, just before 8:00am, on Sunday morning, December 7, 1941. The United States formally entered WWII the next day.","Following the attack on Pearl Harbor by the Imperial Japanese Navy Air Service, the United States formally joins the Allied powers in WWII.","The Allied invasion of Normandy, France during WWII. It was the largest seaborne invasion in history. The operation began the liberation of German-occupied France (and later western Europe) and laid the foundations of the Allied victory on the Western Front.","The final battles of the European Theatre of World War II took place in late April and early May 1945. Following news of the German surrender, celebrations erupted around the world on May 7th, also known as VE-Day.","The surrender of Imperial Japan was announced by Japanese Emperor Hirohito on August 15 and formally signed on September 2, 1945, bringing the hostilities of World War II to a close. By the end of July 1945, the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) was incapable of conducting major operations and an Allied invasion of Japan was imminent. Together with the British Empire and China, the United States called for the unconditional surrender of the Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945—the alternative being \"prompt and utter destruction\".","The invasion of Poland marked the beginning of World War II. The German invasion began on September 1st, 1939, one week after the signing of the Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact between Germany and the Soviet Union, and one day after the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union had approved the pact. The Soviets invaded Poland on September 17th. The campaign ended on 6 October 6th with Germany and the Soviet Union dividing and annexing the whole of Poland under the terms of the German–Soviet Frontier Treaty.","The Harlem riot of 1964 occurred between July 16 and 22, 1964. It began after James Powell, a 15-year-old African American, was shot and killed by police Lieutenant Thomas Gilligan in front of Powell's friends and about a dozen other witnesses. Immediately after the shooting, about 300 students from Powell's school who were informed by the principal rallied. The shooting set off six consecutive nights of rioting that affected the New York City neighborhoods of Harlem and Bedford-Stuyvesant. In total, 4,000 New Yorkers participated in the riots which led to attacks on the New York City Police Department, vandalism, and looting in stores. Several protesters were severely beaten by NYPD officers. At the end of the conflict, reports counted one dead rioter, 118 injured, and 465 arrested.","The 1943 race riot in Beaumont, Texas, erupted on June 15 and ended two days later. It related to wartime tensions in the overcrowded city, which had been flooded by workers from across the South. The immediate catalyst to white workers from the Pennsylvania Shipyard in Beaumont attacking blacks and their property was a rumor that a white woman had been raped by a black man. This was one of several riots in the summer of 1943 in which blacks suffered disproportionately as victims and had the greatest losses in property damage.","Description needed.","The Double V campaign was a slogan and drive to promote the fight for democracy in overseas campaigns and at the home front in the United States for African Americans during World War II. The Double V refers to the \"V for victory\" sign prominently displayed by countries fighting \"for victory over aggression, slavery, and tyranny,\" but adopts a second \"V\" to represent the double victory for African Americans fighting for freedom overseas and at home.","The internment of Japanese Americans in the United States during World War II was the forced relocation and incarceration in concentration camps in the western interior of the country of about 120,000 people of Japanese ancestry, most of whom lived on the Pacific Coast. Sixty-two percent of the internees were United States citizens. These actions were ordered by President Franklin D. Roosevelt shortly after Imperial Japan's attack on Pearl Harbor.","The Bracero program (from the Spanish term bracero, meaning \"manual laborer\" or \"one who works using his arms\") was a series of laws and diplomatic agreements, initiated on August 4, 1942, when the United States signed the Mexican Farm Labor Agreement with Mexico. For these farmworkers, the agreement guaranteed decent living conditions (sanitation, adequate shelter and food), and a minimum wage of 30 cents an hour, as well as protections from forced military service, and guaranteed part of wages were to be put into a private savings account in Mexico; it also allowed the importation of contract laborers from Guam as a temporary measure during the early phases of World War II.","Benjamin Oliver Davis Jr. (December 18, 1912 – July 4, 2002) was an American United States Air Force general and commander of the World War II Tuskegee Airmen. He was the second African-American general officer in the United States Air Force. (See General Daniel “Chappie” James Jr.) On December 9, 1998, he was advanced to four-star general by President Bill Clinton. During World War II, Davis was commander of the 99th Fighter Squadron and the 332nd Fighter Group, which escorted bombers on air combat missions over Europe. Davis flew sixty missions in P-39, Curtiss P-40, P-47 and P-51 Mustang fighters. Davis followed in his father's footsteps in breaking racial barriers, as Benjamin O. Davis Sr. was the first African-American general in the United States Army.","The civil rights movement (also known as the American civil rights movement and other terms) in the United States was a decades-long struggle by African Americans to end legalized racial discrimination, disenfranchisement and racial segregation in the United States. The movement has its origins in the Reconstruction era during the late 19th century, although the movement achieved its largest legislative gains in the mid-1960s after years of direct actions and grassroots protests. The social movement's major nonviolent resistance campaigns eventually secured new protections in federal law for the human rights of all Americans.","The Freeman Field mutiny was a series of incidents at Freeman Army Airfield, a United States Army Air Forces base near Seymour, Indiana, in 1945 in which African American members of the 477th Bombardment Group attempted to integrate an all-white officers' club. The mutiny resulted in 162 separate arrests of black officers, some of them twice. Three were court-martialed on relatively minor charges. One was convicted. In 1995, the Air Force officially vindicated the actions of the African-American officers, set aside the single court-martial conviction and removed letters of reprimand from the permanent files of 15 of the officers. The mutiny is generally regarded by historians of the Civil Rights Movement as an important step toward full integration of the armed forces and as a model for later efforts to integrate public facilities through civil disobedience.","The March on Washington Movement (MOWM), 1941–1946, organized by activists A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin as a tool to produce a mass march on Washington, D.C., was designed to pressure the U.S. government into desegregating the armed forces and providing fair working opportunities for African Americans. When President Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 in 1941, prohibiting discrimination in the defense industry under contract to federal agencies, Randolph and collaborators called off the march.","The Tuskegee Airmen were a group of African-American and Caribbean-born military pilots (fighter and bomber) who fought in World War II between December 8th, 1941 and September 2nd, 1945. They formed the 332nd Fighter Group and the 477th Bombardment Group of the United States Army Air Forces. The name also applies to the navigators, bombardiers, mechanics, instructors, crew chiefs, nurses, cooks and other support personnel.","Signed by FDR on June 25, 1941, to prohibit ethnic or racial discrimination in the nation's defense industry. It also set up the Fair Employment Practice Committee. It was the first federal action, though not a law, to promote equal opportunity and prohibit employment discrimination in the United States. Many citizens of Italian or German ethnicity were affected by World War II and this was impeding the war effort and lowering morale. The President's statement that accompanied the Order cited the war effort, saying that \"the democratic way of life within the nation can be defended successfully only with the help and support of all groups.” The executive order had also been demanded by civil rights activists A. Philip Randolph, Walter White, and others involved in the March on Washington Movement. They suspended the march after Executive Order 8802 was issued.","Survey 32 was a survey given to military personnel in March of 1943 that asked questions about how both Black and white soldiers felt about segregation in the military. This novel data set is the source of our data and the focus of our work.","On December 1, 1955, in Montgomery, Alabama, Rosa Parks rejected bus driver James F. Blake's order to relinquish her seat in the \"colored section\" to a white passenger, after the whites-only section was filled. Parks was not the first person to resist bus segregation, but the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) believed that she was the best candidate for seeing through a court challenge after her arrest for civil disobedience in violating Alabama segregation laws. Parks' prominence in the community and her willingness to become a controversial figure inspired the black community to boycott the Montgomery buses for over a year, the first major direct action campaign of the post-war civil rights movement. Her case became bogged down in the state courts, but the federal Montgomery bus lawsuit Browder v. Gayle succeeded in November 1956.","Emmett Louis Till (July 25, 1941 – August 28, 1955) was a 14-year-old African American who was lynched in Mississippi in 1955, after being accused of offending a white woman in her family's grocery store. The brutality of his murder and the fact that his killers were acquitted drew attention to the long history of violent persecution of African Americans in the United States. Till posthumously became an icon of the civil rights movement.","The Montgomery bus boycott was a political and social protest campaign against the policy of racial segregation on the public transit system of Montgomery, Alabama. It was a seminal event in the civil rights movement. The campaign lasted from December 5, 1955 — the Monday after Rosa Parks, an African-American woman, was arrested for refusing to surrender her seat to a white person — to December 20, 1956, when the federal ruling Browder v. Gayle took effect, and led to a United States Supreme Court decision that declared the Alabama and Montgomery laws that segregated buses were unconstitutional."],"Source":["https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943_Detroit_race_riot","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agana_race_riot","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_9981","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jackie_Robinson","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attack_on_Pearl_Harbor","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Military_history_of_the_United_States_during_World_War_II","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normandy_landings","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/End_of_World_War_II_in_Europe","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surrender_of_Japan","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Invasion_of_Poland","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Harlem_riot_of_1964","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beaumont_race_riot_of_1943","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1943_Detroit_race_riot#Sojourner_Truth_Housing_Project","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_V_campaign","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internment_of_Japanese_Americans","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bracero_program","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benjamin_O._Davis_Jr.","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Civil_rights_movement","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Freeman_Field_mutiny","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/March_on_Washington_Movement","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tuskegee_Airmen","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Executive_Order_8802"," https://theconversation.com/the-american-gi-in-wwii-uncensored-113243","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rosa_Parks","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Emmett_Till","https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Montgomery_bus_boycott"]},"type":"data.frame","container":"svg","options":null,"script":"var d3Script = function(d3, r2d3, data, svg, width, height, options, theme, console) {\nthis.d3 = d3;\n\nsvg = d3.select(svg.node());\n/* R2D3 Source File:  am_soldier_timeline.js */\n// !preview r2d3 data=c(0.3, 0.6, 0.8, 0.95, 0.40, 0.20)\n//\n// r2d3: https://rstudio.github.io/r2d3\n//\n\nvar vw = width; // get viewport width\nvar vh = height; // get viewport height\n\nvar data;\nvar tooltip;\n\nvar minDate, maxDate;\nvar startX = 0;\n\nvar margin = {\n    top: 20,\n    bottom: 0,\n    left: 25,\n    right: 25,\n};\n\nvar canvasWidth = width;\nvar canvasHeight = height;\n\nvar cv_Y = margin.top + 25; // y value of civil rights line\nvar mi_Y = height -

        <h3>Our Approach</h3>
        <p style="text-align:justify">To analyze US soldiers’ attitudes, we employed various strategies from computational text analysis and social network analysis to examine Survey 32. This is a survey that includes one multiple choice question on whether or not soldiers want separated or integrated outfits and two response questions giving space for them to extend on their multiple choice answer and their sentiments on the survey as a whole. After an initial phase of data wrangling and cleaning, we first conducted some exploratory data analysis to find out more about the backgrounds of the soldiers that completed the survey. Next, we used the <a href="https://www.tidytextmining.com/">tidytext</a>, a package available in the R open-source software environment, to conduct word frequency analyses as well as stemming and lemmatization to control for variations in the text corpus. Second, we conducted sentiment analysis to gain a better understand of what emotionally-charged words soldiers used to weigh in on racial and gender relations. Next, we used topic modeling to capture prominent themes that emerged within the survey. Lastly, we combined computational text analysis and social network analysis to identify bigram and co-occurence relations within the text, which we then graphed using the open-source software program Gephi to visualize how different terms within in the text are used together.</p>
